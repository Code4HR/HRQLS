Every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information provided.

The data provided cannot be aggregated to calculate official crime volume and rates in Virginia Beach.  Official crime statistics can be found in the Virginia Beach Police Department Annual Reports.

About Neighborhood Crime: Information contained in this report is in Incident Based Reporting (IBR) format. Under IBR each offense (the crimes) that occurs during the incident (the event) is counted. This is in contrast to Uniform Crime Report (UCR) rules, where only the most severe offense is counted. For example, if a rape and robbery occurred in the same incident, under IBR both the rape and robbery are counted. Under the UCR system, only the rape is counted.  
Secondary crimes are denoted by an asterisk (*). The ATT/COM column refers to attempted or completed offenses. All victims involved in a Crime Against Persons are counted. For example, if an assault occurred with three victims, the report lists three lines of data. Motor vehicle thefts are counted once for each vehicle stolen. Unfounded incidents are excluded, meaning that after further investigation, the police determined that the reported crime did not actually occur. Incidents containing “Undetermined” in the Neighborhood column could not be matched to a neighborhood. The street number most likely fell outside the block range contained in our database.

About Incident Reports:  Information contained in this report represents the number of reports written by VBPD officers.  It is not in UCR or IBR format.

About Accident Reports:  Information contained in this report represents the number of accident calls for service received in the E911 Center.  The call may not result in a report.
